predict the output:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int number = -4;
char result;
result = number > 0 ? 'P' : 'N';
cout << result << endl;
return 0;
}

Explanation:

The first line of the code includes the iostream header file, 
which is necessary for performing input and output operations.

The using namespace std; statement brings the entire std 
namespace into scope, so that we don't have to prefix every 
standard library identifier with std::.

The main() function is the entry point of the program.

int number = -4; 
-4 value is stored inside the int number 

char result;
a variable named result of character data type occupies 1 byte 
space in the memory. 

result = number > 0 ? 'P' : 'N';
number > 0 ? 'P' : 'N' this will be executed first.
statement is false as number = -4
so, inside result N is stored.

cout << result << endl;
N is printed 
endl gives one new line.

Output:
N
