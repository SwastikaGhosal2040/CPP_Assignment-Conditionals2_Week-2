predict the output:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int a = 18; int b = 12;
bool t = (a > 20 && b < 15)? true : false;
cout <<"Value of t: " << t ;
return 0;
}

Explanation:

The first line of the code includes the iostream header file, 
which is necessary for performing input and output operations.

The using namespace std; statement brings the entire std 
namespace into scope, so that we don't have to prefix every 
standard library identifier with std::.

The main() function is the entry point of the program.

int a = 18; int b = 12;
The value 18 is stored inside int a and 
The value 12 is stored inside int b.

bool t = (a > 20 && b < 15)? true : false;
(a > 20 && b < 15)? true : false; this will be executed 1st.
a>20 is false so, it returns false
bool t = false = 0

cout <<"Value of t: " << t ;
Value of t: 0
 
Output :
Value of t: 0
