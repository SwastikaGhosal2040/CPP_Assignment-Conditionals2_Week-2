Predict the output:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main( ) {
int a = 5, b, c ;
b = a = 15 ;
c = a < 15 ;
cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << " , c = "<< c ;
return 0;
}

As a,b,c are int data type, they are taking 4 bytes space in the memory.
5 value is assigned in a. 
Now, 15 is assigned to a. The value of a = 15
Value of a is assigned to b. Now, b = 15
Relational operatoe(<) having higher precedence than assignment operator(=)
a<15 will be executed first. 15<15 is false. 
means, c = false = 0

Output:
a = 15, b = 15 , c = 0
