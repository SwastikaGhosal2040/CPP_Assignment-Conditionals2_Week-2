//predict the output:

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int test = 0;
cout << "First character " << '1' << endl;
cout << "Second character " << (test ? 3 : '1') << endl;
return 0;
}

Explanation:

The first line of the code includes the iostream header file, 
which is necessary for performing input and output operations.

The using namespace std; statement brings the entire std 
namespace into scope, so that we don't have to prefix every 
standard library identifier with std::.

The main() function is the entry point of the program.

The int test = 0; statement declares an integer variable named 
test and initializes it to 0.
'test' is the name of the variable and it is of int data type
which can store only int type of value.

cout << "First character " << '1' << endl;
This line will print:
First character 1
endl prints a new line.

cout << "Second character " << (test ? 3 : '1') << endl;
Second character is printed and after that the result of 
(test ? 3 : '1') is printed and after that for endl, a new
line is printed.
(test ? 3 : '1') after execution of this statement,
int test should store char '1' as test!=3, test=0, 
so fale statement.
But int test can't store char '1' so it will store the ASCII 
value of '1' = 49 = int.

output should be:
First character 1
Second character 49
