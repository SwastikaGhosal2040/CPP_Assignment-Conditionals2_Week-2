Predict the output:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
int x = 3 ;
float y = 3.0 ;
if (x == y)
cout <<"x and y are equal" ;
else
cout << "x and y are not equal" ;
return 0;
}

The output will be "x and y are equal."

 This is because the if statement is checking for equality between x and y,
  and in this case, even though one is an integer and the other is a float, 
  their values are the same (3), so the condition is true.
